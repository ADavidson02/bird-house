      information: `The main bed is a very comfy queen mattress on a custom murphy bed.
            The murphy bed is designed to fold up to make more space if needed.
            No expense was spared with the sleeping arrangements as a good night
            sleep is one of the most important factors for a great stay! There
            is also a desk that can be flipped out when the murphy bed is up!
            You will find another bed as a queen sleeper sofa with an upgraded
            memory foam mattress. I like to let our reviews to speak for
            themselves and the mattresses are always very important. (From
            Leslie, we were exhausted in the evening, and the beds were so comfy
            - even the sofa sleeper!)`,
