      information: `The main bed is a very comfy queen mattress on a custom murphy bed.
            The murphy bed is designed to fold up to make more space if needed.
            No expense was spared with the sleeping arrangements as a good night
            sleep is one of the most important factors for a great stay! There
            is also a desk that can be flipped out when the murphy bed is up!
            You will find another bed as a queen sleeper sofa with an upgraded
            memory foam mattress. I like to let our reviews to speak for
            themselves and the mattresses are always very important. (From
            Leslie, we were exhausted in the evening, and the beds were so comfy
            - even the sofa sleeper!)`,

            a sofa to relax while drinking your morning coffee and watch the sun
            rise over the lake! Out the front windows and over the North West
            side of the deck you can get a small view of the Rocky Mountains.
            You may also use the gate in our backyard to access miles of trails
            around the different neighborhoods and a walk around the lake, just
            know this is our space and our dogs may come out to say hello! The
            views of the Rocky Mountains from the lake are amazing! This is by
            far my favorite part of our place, enjoying the scenery and fresh
            air!`

      information: `You will also find an all in one washer and dryer in the walk-in
            closet making long term stays very convenient. No need to move from
            the washer to the dryer, this one machine does both! 420 Friendly –
            It’s Colorado, it’s legal, so have some fun. Just please be
            respectful and do not smoke inside and please keep the windows and
            doors closed while smoking. The deck is a perfect location to
            partake, please just be respectful of our neighbors and their kids.
            Be discrete please. Window coverings are designed for privacy when
            needed but still allow for natural light with adjustable shutters,
            top down bottom up blinds and sheer or blackout curtains. When they
            are all closed you can easily sleep during the day if needed. We do
            live in the main home that you can see in the last picture. If you
            read through the reviews, many people will mention how private the
            place is. With the deck being on the back you will hardly ever see
            us unless we are also enjoying the backyard. We do use the garage
            below you, however you can hardly hear it open with how well
            insulated the floor is. We do have 2 dogs. They are both friendly
            but our white dog, Varly, will bark at you if he is outside until he
            is comfortable with you, then he just wants to kiss you. They have
            no access to you unless you choose to enter our backyard. If you are
            missing your own dogs, or just want to say hello, please feel free
            to but always close gates behind you and do not let them out of the
            fenced area. Pack and play as well as a baby gate are available for
            your use in the Bird House for those traveling with children. Thanks
            for your interest in our place and please do not hesitate to reach
            out with any additional questions!`
