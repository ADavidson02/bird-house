                  Immaculate, spotless, perfection are some of the words which
                  come to mind to describe this property. It is located in a
                  great neighborhood and has an awesome deck. The property has
                  all the amenities you need and more. Last but not least, Micah
                  and his wife are such super friendly people and amazing hosts.
                  Thoroughly enjoyed my stay for 2 weeks and wish it was longer`,

      writtenReview: `The bird house was a really great place for us to vacation! We
                  stayed about a week. Could not have asked for a better place.
                  The kitchen was stocked very well with spices and
                  pots/pans/spatulas/plates/eating utensils. Place was sparkling
                  clean when we arrived and responses were quick from the host.
                  Lots of entertainment on the TV (Xbox,Netflix,Disney+). The
                  balcony was great for eating outside and star gazing! For the
                  price point I don’t think there’s a better place out there;
                  highly recommend if you’re wanting a place outside the city a
                  bit and don’t mind driving some.`,
