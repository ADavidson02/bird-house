                  Immaculate, spotless, perfection are some of the words which
                  come to mind to describe this property. It is located in a
                  great neighborhood and has an awesome deck. The property has
                  all the amenities you need and more. Last but not least, Micah
                  and his wife are such super friendly people and amazing hosts.
                  Thoroughly enjoyed my stay for 2 weeks and wish it was longer`,

      writtenReview: `The bird house was a really great place for us to vacation! We
                  stayed about a week. Could not have asked for a better place.
                  The kitchen was stocked very well with spices and
                  pots/pans/spatulas/plates/eating utensils. Place was sparkling
                  clean when we arrived and responses were quick from the host.
                  Lots of entertainment on the TV (Xbox,Netflix,Disney+). The
                  balcony was great for eating outside and star gazing! For the
                  price point I don’t think there’s a better place out there;
                  highly recommend if you’re wanting a place outside the city a
                  bit and don’t mind driving some.`,

      writtenReview: `Micah/’s Bird House space was outstanding. There are many
                  Airbnb’s to choose from in Denver, I am so glad I decided to
                  book with Micah. This host is not only friendly and
                  personable, but very communicative. The apartment itself was
                  set up like a big open studio. It was comfortable, stylish,
                  bright, and welcoming. I was in the area to explore but found
                  myself staying in more than I anticipated because I loved this
                  space so much. I felt extremely safe which is a huge part of
                  why I choose certain Airbnb’s as a solo gal. The a/c and heat
                  worked like a charm and the kitchen has everything you could
                  ever need to prepare meals. Thank you for the complimentary
                  coffee, tea, and hot chocolate; those touches are always so
                  appreciated. I stayed here during my last few nights in
                  Colorado so having access to the washer/dryer was such a huge
                  perk. I came home with all fresh, clean clothes! Thank you
                  again, Micah. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.`,

      writtenReview: `If I had to describe this little Airbnb in one word it would be “quality!” The decor, thoughtful touches, location, appliances and electronics are all made from the best. My husband and I booked it for a “rest and recoup” whilst driving cross-country and it provided for all our needs. Had we been there to explore the area, there was also great local recommendations in the handy guide. Definitely book yourself a stay here!`,

      writtenReview: `Micah’s place is wonderful for a couple that’s trying to get away for a few days. The scenery was pleasant. The mountains can be viewed from the large deck. Me & my spouse came during the winter months, and their place heats up rather quick and gets and stays comfortable throughout the stay. The LED lights around the residence was a great way to set the mood. This residence was not difficult to find, and was in a quiet neighborhood. The mattress and pillows were very comfy I believe them both to be memory foam. Micah did a great job listing places to eat as well as places to go to have fun. They were located just 30 minutes north of Denver so the travel time was not really bad at all. I would definitely book with The Bird House in the near future.`,

Micah is a great host and and ready to help out when ever needed. The Bird House will definitely be at the top of my list of places to stay on my next trip to Colorado.`,

      writtenReview: `The Birdhouse was such a great place to stay for our quick weekend getaway. The high end finishes and efficient use of space made for such an enjoyable and relaxing stay. We loved having the private patio to sit outside and enjoy the great weather and views. Would absolutely stay here again.`,

      writtenReview: `The Birdhouse was a perfect “home base” during our most recent trip to Colorado. We wanted to explore the Boulder and surrounding areas more this time, and this location was great for that - plus Denver is close enough for some “bigger city” adventures! We planned to cook the majority of our meals, and the Birdhouse kitchen allowed us to make all of our favorites given how well stocked it was with good quality equipment! While the space is studio style, there is PLENTY of storage for our luggage that kept the space feeling clean, open and spacious. The patio was also fantastic for sunrises and a little extra space. When you stay, definitely walk the path right off from the backyard. The lake is stunning with good mountains views as well. Check in and communication were top notch- Micah and Amanda definitely deserve their Super Host badge!`,

      writtenReview: `5 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐. The Bird House was great! Pretty much exactly as pictured. Nice space and great balcony off of the back. Very accessible to Estes Park and the Rocky Mountains (only about an hour drive). We also visited during a snow storm in Summer and Micah was very flexible with allowing us to stay longer if needed. All was much appreciated and we will book again when we come back!`,
